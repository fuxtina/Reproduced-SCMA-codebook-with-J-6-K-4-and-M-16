# Reproduced SCMA codebook with J=6 K=4 and M=16

This SCMA codebook is considered in the simulation of the paper "A Simplified Sphere Decoding-Based Detector for Generalized SCMA Codebooks".

The original paper that proposed this codebook is "SCMA codebook design" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6966170).
